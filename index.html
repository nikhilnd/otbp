          <a href="img/individual/LiseBjorne.jpg" class="fancybox" data-fancybox="JungJungyeob" data-caption="Inspired by Man Ray's rayographs, Lise Bjorne created the Breath Series in a darkroom without use of a camera. As she breathes, screams, and yells, a trace of her out-breath is captured by the light sensitive paper. The movement of her knees, hands and mouth leave empty, dark areas on the image.  These shadows are all that remain of her outburst--no matter how violent. She remains hushed and invisible.">

          <a href="img/individual/MiriNishriF.jpg" class="fancybox" data-fancybox="JungJungyeob" data-caption="On the outskirts of Tel Aviv, in a swampy dumping ground adjacent to a highway, lays a forgotten forest dedicated to the biblical Esther. It was here that she is said to have hid from those who loved her and those who wanted her dead. A man comes here, unseen, and leaves poems in the trees. In her video, Miri Nishri has given him a voice, disembodied, haunting. He recites not love poems but poems of an obsessive.  Aggressive, frighteningly blunt.  The trees call out to Esther, whose persona is split into two-a young prostitute and an old homeless woman.  The two alternately merge and wander apart as they await their fate. The anonymous hunter/poet shadows them.  The viewer is put in his shoes, stalking them.">

She asked her subjects to project their futures: How does a modern girl forecast life fifty years from now?  Yanagi found that rather than dreading the indignities of aging, the women believed they will enjoy power, respect, and adventure.  They flipped Japanese tradition, refusing to conform to the role of the crone, or that of the perpetual girl. Using makeup, costumes, and digital manipulation, Yanagi transformed the young women into their future selves.  The resulting images are of strong old ladies who freely express themselves.">
