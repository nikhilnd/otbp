              <br>
              <p>Throughout the world, women and girls are victims of countless and senseless acts of violence. The range of violence against women is devastating, occuring, quite literally, from womb to tomb. It occurs in every segment of society, regardless of class, ethnicity, culture, or whether the country is at peace or war.</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>This is the context for Off the Beaten Path: Violence, Women and Art (OTBP), and innovative, multi-media traveling contemporary art exhibition that utilizes works by world-class artists to promote awareness and behavioral choices; inspire the belief that communities can change a culture of violence; empower girls and women with respect to domestic violence, exploitation and discrimination; and address systems for social change. The beauty of this project is that it combines the highest integrity of art with important messaging and storytelling. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="writing">
              <p>When we encounter violence against women, we often experience a sort of blindness. We choose not to see the devastation of domestic violence, calling it “a family affair.” Honor-killings of women in faraway regions of the world become nothing more than a “cultural difference.” We find it hard to believe that sex trafficking and exploitation occur in our cities, close to home. The rape and torture of women during armed conflict is the inevitable “messiness of war.” As such, the political and systemic sources of violence are underestimated or overlooked.</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>Premised on the visionary, poetic and prophetic potential in art, the stories that underlie these artworks by 32 artists from around the world return us imaginatively to the event of violation and allow it to affect us. Avoiding tabloid and sensational imagery, we ask the artists to help us create a new vocabulary - new representations - through their artworks, and in doing so, heal us, and transform us and help us feel and understand the essence of the problem of violence against women. And in the process we begin to forge a new journey - off the beaten path.</p>

              <p>It begins in the nucleus of an egg cell. Chromosomes meet. The Xs and Ys determine how cortical sex cords will form. For the first few weeks of fertilization, boys are no different than girls. Only in the ninth week does it become clear that the gonads will keep growing and become testes, or turn inward and develop under cover as ovaries. The female experience begins. Folding inward.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Some cultures honor the mysterious unseen qualities of womanhood, but it is far more common to give power to what is seen. The girl is often expected to remain hidden, smaller, silent. Or decorative, available, and sweet. There are women who rebel and raise their voices, fight. Their battles are waged in the seemingly safe lawns of suburbia, bright classrooms, shopping malls. Battle scars appear in these seemingly benign environments. The fragile ribs of an anorexic. The deformed foot stepping out of a stiletto. The false laughter ringing through the halls of a high school.</p>

These shadows are all that remain of her outburst--no matter how violent. She remains hushed and invisible.</p>

                  <p class="description">On the outskirts of Tel Aviv, in a swampy dumping ground adjacent to a highway, lays a forgotten forest dedicated to the biblical Esther. It was here that she is said to have hid from those who loved her and those who wanted her dead. A man comes here, unseen, and leaves poems in the trees. In her video, Miri Nishri has given him a voice, disembodied, haunting. He recites not love poems but poems of an obsessive.  Aggressive, frighteningly blunt.  The trees call out to Esther, whose persona is split into two-a young prostitute and an old homeless woman.  The two alternately merge and wander apart as they await their fate. The anonymous hunter/poet shadows them.  The viewer is put in his shoes, stalking them.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Every family begins within the body of a woman. She is the miracle maker. Her body provides the first dwelling, the first repast, the first contact. But instead of being honored as a temple, she is more often treated as a slave. Or worse. Women become victims of violence in their own homes more than any other environment. The most powerful adversary is often the one who knows his victim most intimately. In many cultures, if a woman is perceived as violating her role, if she attempts to assume power or have the audacity to make decisions about her body, violence is an accepted response. There are times when a woman must break the branches of her family trees, leave the shadowy shelter, and find her own "family" in the world.

The color red back-grounding white birds, a rabbit chasing a farmer, an outstretched hand, and a headless, armless figure, suggests rage and conflict amid fleeting peace and tortured domesticity. Inky black spreads at the top of the painting, where a head is missing, indicate encroaching despair, doom, and a lack of leadership.  A child's skeleton rests in the ribcage of the larger figure and it too is headless.  The missing arms suggest a lack of power, the missing head, a lack of identity but the white birds walking on the figure suggest that peace, while difficult to corner, is present.</p>

                      <p class="description">Louise Bourgeois's drawings and sculptures often explore themes of intimate relationships, home, familial hierarchy, motherhood, and sexuality with rebellious originality. In this piece, a female figure is alone in a black tunnel. Her torso is skewered by a crutch, she is cobbled by her high heels, nude, armless, yet she smiles complacently. Like a woman trapped in a violent family situation, she wears a mask that tells the world everything is just fine.</p>

              <p>Community of sisterhood is powerful. Whether it be an artist collective, a political group, a book club, or a girl's school, the gathering of women in solidarity leads to the development of their voices, their skills and knowledge. Unfettered by expectations of submissiveness, surrounded by true peers, a woman can say what she needs, share what she knows, ask for credit where it is due, learn her rights. The billboards and television shows and magazines may all tell her she should look and act a certain way. Be pleasing and quiescent. But a true community can tell her otherwise. She rises above the noise and discovers her presence, her gravity, her wisdom. With these tools she begins to integrate into the larger community, skillfully, and with confidence. </p>

In discussion, their desire was not to tell stories about prostitution or affirm or defend their choice of work. In fact, what she discovered of primary concern was their lack of comfort in their own body image because of social stigma. The work resulted in an exploration that went beyond the face-to-face encounter and representation of the portrait by the artist. Over time, Fina began to look at the relationship between the model, the artist and public within the larger context of art history.</p>

              <p>What is tradition? When should it be rejected? Certain acts or practices may be repeated throughout the centuries, but that does not necessarily mean they should be honored and protected. Yet we live in a world in which harmful, sometimes violent, cultural practices are accepted despite the fact that they can lead to physical and psychological harm to women. The practices of female genital mutilation, dowry murder, "honor killings,- early marriage, and other ritualized human rights violations persist.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It takes individual courage to challenge deeply imbedded belief systems. It takes collective outrage to create change within a culture. But if we are to see the pandemic of violence against women subside, outrage must be channeled into peaceful action. New traditions, ones that empower rather than subjugate, have the potential to emerge but only if we plant seeds of understanding and compassion are planted.</p>

In particular, she is interested in the stories of women and children who are often erased from social history. It's something she experienced first-hand. During the Cultural Revolution, Liu's family photographs were confiscated as part of a campaign to encourage less individual identity. Much of the imagery in her painting is based on 19th and 20th century photographs taken by Western visitors to China. In Demeter we see a young woman captured under the heft of a huge load, yet Liu has imbued the image with levity, beauty and hope.  She has rewritten the woman's history. "The artwork is my way of painting life back into memories," she says.</p>

Thomas digitally manipulated and appropriated the images, removing any signature of the client -text, logos, slogans. He left the images unaltered and in doing so he revealed what is actually being "sold". In this piece, we see a powerful black man flanked by two white women.  He is seated like a king, his expression tough, a cigar jutting upward from his open mouth.  A fruit basket sits at his feet.  The women each drape a hand over his knee.  What is not being said?  Sometimes the unspoken is deafening.</p>

While the artist usually works in color, her choice of white on white reflects the subtle ways in which women are erased as their voices and identities are devalued and minimized in Confucian tradition. Starting in the late 14th century, Korean culture began stripping rights away from women by imposing limits on their freedom of movement, inheritance, marriage, and ancestral rituals. By 1800, as if they were invisible ghosts, daughters weren't even entered in family registers.</p>

Through eroticism and the sexual act, the human attempts to be equal with the gods: the woman marries the sun and the man marries the moon.  Through the impetus of becoming at one with the heavens, the individual tries to preserve the secret of fertility, creative energy and the strength of the cosmic forces. According to this folklore, the individuals believed  that through the fusion with the gods, they take on superhuman qualities.</p>

The mutable quality of female identity and the dueling forces of tradition and emancipation are fundamental to Menlibayeva's work. The women in her videos are not held to culture-specific or gender-based expectations and are, therefore, free. Menlibayeva suggests that one day these subversive women will be the bearers of new values.</p>

                      <p class="description">Bride-burning is a form of domestic violence practiced in Pakistan and other countries located on or around the Indian subcontinent.  Bride-burning occurs when a young woman is murdered by her husband or his family for her family's refusal to pay additional dowry. The wife is typically doused with kerosene, gasoline, or other flammable liquid, and set alight, burning to death. In some cases, the attack is disguised as an accident or as suicide. According to an Amnesty International report in 1999, though 1,600 "bride-burnings" were reported, only 60 were prosecuted and just two resulted in convictions.</p>

The result is a highly aesthetic topical commentary that contains a barrage of references ranging from historical to immediate.  He illustrates the duality of human nature with a combination of sacred tropes and modern sin; the staff carried by a priest in a religious procession is also the stripper's pole. Since the late 1990s, he has been producing figurative paintings addressing social and political issues, especially the abuse of children, women and nuns by priests. These paintings borrow from well-known Renaissance paintings.</p>

                      <p class="description">In The Flight, the artist presents a series of seven small floating dresses crafted from feathers, coral, boar's teeth, and other exotic materials. Her combination of contemporary fashion and traditional materials is a fashion statement that recalls the Andean re-signification that caused friction in the Roman Catholic church in the 16th century.

                      <p class="description">Eleven hundred people from 23 countries have participated in Desconocida,the Spanish word meaning "unknown," by embroidering nametags of missing loved ones from Juarez, Mexico. The names, attached to the wall,  are arranged in morse code to spell out the Mexican Anthem. The project, a call for help, addresses the critical situation in Juarez, a city on the border of Mexico and the United States, where women have been found raped, tortured, and killed since 1993. Hundreds more continue to disappear, most murders remain unsolved with no end in sight. Desconocida is a community-based project to fight against abuse, femicide and human trafficking.</p>

              <p>What is tradition? When should it be rejected? Certain acts or practices may be repeated throughout the centuries, but that does not necessarily mean they should be honored and protected. Yet we live in a world in which harmful, sometimes violent, cultural practices are accepted despite the fact that they can lead to physical and psychological harm to women. The practices of female genital mutilation, dowry murder, "honor killings,- early marriage, and other ritualized human rights violations persist.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It takes individual courage to challenge deeply imbedded belief systems. It takes collective outrage to create change within a culture. But if we are to see the pandemic of violence against women subside, outrage must be channeled into peaceful action. New traditions, ones that empower rather than subjugate, have the potential to emerge but only if we plant seeds of understanding and compassion are planted.</p>

For Plum, they reference the sacred act of sweeping the temples in Pre-Hispanic Mexico, an act that was performed during ritual cleansing and was also thought to elicit the earth's healing spirit.  Plum created these over-sized brooms to invoke healing for the senseless death and disappearance of women and girls  from Juarez, a Mexican border town across from El Paso. The scale of the objects conjures the enormity of the loss.<br> <br>In the video performance, 25 women use the sounds and movement of brooms, wind whistles, bullroarers, and spinners as a limpia---a shamanic cleansing for the murdered daughters and a gift of empowerment to the mothers of the missing.</p>

Clad in a skirt, blouse, apron and kerchief, Mutu gets on her hands and knees, throwing her back into the job. Her repetitive sweeping circular motions, the grainy footage that obscures detail, and the video's unedited, single take all make for tedious watching. As we endure, five, ten, fifteen minutes, the women gets more mud on herself than off the floor, she begins to tire, and eventually flops lethargically into the mud. We don t just see the futility of her task--we feel it too.</p>

Both works are based on a Roman myth in which the raped and captured women intervene on the battlefield to stop the war. On the field the women and children surged en masse and came between the two armies. In this ecstatic gesture, the women forced the unification of these two cultures and resulted in the expansion of Rome. In the video, Sussman recasts the two sides of the myth in a 1960's context: Romans become G-men and the Sabines are butchers' daughters.</p>

By conjuring animal nature, Alexander elucidates the cycle of violence that is a natural part of survival for animals. By putting it in a suit or a dress she questions why violence exists in civilized society where it isn't necessary for survival.</p>

Who better to describe the circumstance than the women themselves using photography, eliminates all language barriers? Women living in areas of conflict are frequently portrayed as helpless and voiceless. We see them in news photos and they appear mute: working, holding children, hauling water and firewood, or just staring into the lens. The IRC has asked them to document their lives and the results are profound. They are anything but mute. We hear their voices, see their strength, and witness their pride.<br>Click the right arrow to see all 20 pictures</p>
